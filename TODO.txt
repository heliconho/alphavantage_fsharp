BackTest
1. First of all we determine the (technical) strategy to be tested
2. As a result, we list the market data we need; typically one or more instruments and zero or more indicators
3. We write a function that BT will call (as callback).  Later weâ€™ll see how.
4. We call a backtest function passing both the market data and the callback
5. We receive as returned result a backtest report containing the list of trading operations and the final financial result of our strategy (profit or loss)
